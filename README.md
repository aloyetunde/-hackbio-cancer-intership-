DRUG RESISTANCE
Drug resistance is a widely recognized occurrence that arises once illnesses advance a tolerance to medicinal therapies. This idea was initially explored when bacteria developed resistance to specific antibiotics, yet, it has been discovered that other illnesses, such as cancer, also exhibit comparable processes [1]. However, certain forms of drug resistance are specific to disease conditions, while other mechanisms like drug efflux, which is seen in human drug-resistant malignancies and microbes have evolved to be conserved over time [2]. Many types of tumors are initially responsive to chemotherapy, but, the above mechanism (drug efflux) and other processes, like DNA mutations and metabolic alterations that the inhibition and degradation of medication, can cause tumors to become resistant to the treatment over time [3].

Overview of Mechanisms of Drug Resistance in Cancer 
The most researched mechanism of drug resistance in cancer involves reducing chemotherapeutic concentration in cells by enhancing efflux. This efflux is made possible by transmembrane proteins belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, which are significant and well-researched regulators at the plasma membranes of healthy cells. Many drug-resistant tumors are linked to three transporters: breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) [4].
The process of drug inactivation is a complex process that involves the interactions between various proteins and chemicals. Due to this, the drug may be complexed with other molecules or proteins, altered or partially degraded, which will eventually activate the drug. For many anticancer medications to become clinically effective, they first undergo metabolic activation. However, by reducing drug activation, cancer cells can also become resistant to these therapies. An example includes the mutation or downregulation in the activation of cytarabine in treating acute myelogenous leukemia [5]. Further, in cancer cells, a drug’s efficacy can be diminished through target alterations which eventually lead to drug resistance. An example of alterations in signaling mechanisms is tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer [5]. 
Cancer cells often overexpress repair mechanisms, allowing them to survive treatments that induce DNA damage, leading to drug resistance [6]. In addition, cancer cells evade apoptosis by upregulating anti-apoptotic factors, allowing them to resist treatments and persist despite therapy [7]. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enhances cancer cell motility and invasiveness, facilitating metastasis and increasing resistance to therapies by promoting a stem-like state [8]. Tumors contain diverse cell populations with varying traits, making some cells resistant to treatment and contributing to relapse and resistance [3, 9].
