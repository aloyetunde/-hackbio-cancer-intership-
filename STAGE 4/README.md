# NGS Analysis Pipeline
## Description
This repository contains a simple Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis pipeline implemented using various bioinformatics tools. The pipeline performs quality control, trimming, genome mapping, and variant calling on raw sequencing data.

### Installation


### Usage
Ensure all required tools and dependencies are installed by running the setup.sh script. This script will install tools like FastQC, FastP, BWA, and bcftools if they aren't already installed:

 # Run the Pipeline
you can run the pipeline with the script.sh script.
Required Inputs:
Reference Genome: A .fasta file (e.g., reference.fasta)
Forward Strand: A .fastq.gz file containing the forward strand reads (e.g., ACBarrie_R1.fastq.gz)
Reverse Strand: A .fastq.gz file containing the reverse strand reads (e.g., ACBarrie_R2.fastq.gz)

 # Pipeline Workflow
The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Quality Control (FastQC): Analyzes the quality of the raw sequencing reads.
2. Trimming (FastP): Trims the raw reads to remove adapters and low-quality bases.
3. Genome Mapping (BWA): Maps the trimmed reads to the reference genome.
4. Variant Calling (bcftools/freebayes): Identifies variants (SNPs and indels) based on the mapped reads.

 # Output Files
FastQC Reports: Quality control reports for both forward and reverse reads.
Trimmed Reads: Files with trimmed reads for both forward and reverse strands.
BAM/SAM Files: Aligned reads in BAM or SAM format.
VCF Files: Variant call format file containing the identified variants.

### Datasets
Reference Genome: Reference.fasta
Forward Strand: ACBarrie_R1.fastq.gz
Reverse Strand: ACBarrie_R2.fastq.gz
